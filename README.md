# project-well-shrines
Shrines that appear to look like well shrines.

Build shrines to Sadako
They look like wells with a top shrine with a roof covering. Can or can not be an actual well. Must provide for children to climb and fall into. Doesn’t need to be deep. Does need to be dangerously respectful. Don’t leave any evidence that it is a shrine to Sadako and Kayako and this single, dual, triple spirit Yukai.
